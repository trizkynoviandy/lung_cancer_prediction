# Machine Learning for Classification

The purpose of this application is to explore several machine learning algorithms to solve classification problems.

* There are currently three datasets available : Iris, Breast Cancer, and Wine.
* There are currently four algorithms available : K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Naive Bayesian.
